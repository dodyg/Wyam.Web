---
To download Wyam, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Wyamio/Wyam/releases) page and download the most recent 'Wyam.zip' file. Then unzip it into a folder of your choice. That's it. You may also want to add the folder where you unzipped Wyam to your path, but this step is optional. 

**Note that you may also need to right-click the zip file after download and select "Unblock" in the Security section of the properties dialog, otherwise you could get strange errors when using the application.**

Once it becomes a little more mature, Wyam will also be added to Chocolatey.
